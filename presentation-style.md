# Presentation Style

When giving talks, I generally try to avoid plain slide decks. I usually build my presentations using `impress.js`, which means they're 3D. If you've heard of Prezzi, you'll have an idea of what to expect.

## Example Talks

Below are some example talks I've given in this style. When you open them, you can **use the spacebar to move to the next slide**, or the left and right arrow keys to move back and forth.

Keep in mind that the elasicon presentation will be more formal than these examples. The nature of the talks and the target audience allowed them to be very fun and filled with memes, but an elasticon talk would naturally be more stoic and professional.

### The Grand Journey of Search: A DataContext Story

https://smartprocure.github.io/dc-talk

This is an older, very informal talk covering some of the contexture-client design. Back then, contexture leaf nodes were referred to as `DataContexts`, and non leaf nodes were called `ContextGroups`.

It's also worth pointing out that early on in the presentation, there's a part that seems a bit incoherent and hard to follow, which is _intentional_. It's an attempt to narrate how a design without our solution devolves into unmanageable complexity and should in fact be hard to follow. 
    
### Sails v0.11 Upgrade

https://app.smartprocure.us/docs/presentations/sails11

This begins as a "normal" slide show but quickly transforms into something else entirely. This was one of my first talks in this style.

We use `sailsjs` for some projects at SmartProcure, and there were a lot of changes when we upgraded from 0.9 to 0.11 in 2015. Instead of a boring list, this presentation was built to show everything people would notice that was different after the upgrade.
