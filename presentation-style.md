# Presentation Style

When giving talks, I generally try to avoid plain slide decks. I usually build my presentations using `impress.js`, which means they're 3D. If you've heard of Prezzi, you'll have an idea of what to expect.

## Example Talks

Below are some example talks I've given in this style. When you open them, you can **use the spacebar to move to the next slide**, or the left and right arrow keys to move back and forth.

### The Grand Journey of Search: A DataContext Story

https://smartprocure.github.io/dc-talk

This is an older, very informal talk covering some of the contexture-client design. Back then, contexture leaf nodes were referred to as DataContexts, and non leaf nodes were called ContextGroups.
    
### Sails v0.11 Upgrade

https://app.smartprocure.us/docs/presentations/sails11

This begins as a "normal" slide show but quickly transforms into something else entirely. This was one of my first talks in this style.

We use `sailsjs` for some projects at SmartProcure, and when we upgraded from 0.9 to 0.11 in 2015 there were a lot of changes. Instead of a boring list, this presentation was built to show all things that people would notice that was different after the upgrade.
