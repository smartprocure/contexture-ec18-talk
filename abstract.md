Want to build great UIs with the awesome power of elasticsearch? We'll cover the technical challenges of building compelling, highly interactive data exploration (search) UIs. Learn how we built SmartProcure's UI with infinitely nested ANDs and ORs, cross database joins (joining elasticsearch with mongo) and custom analysis. Contextual histograms, ranked choices, charts and tables update live as you edit your query on a billion records with no search button - and its open source, hyper efficient architecture runs only the searches that are absolutely needed.

We'll cover the history, design and implementation of Contexture (github.com/smartprocure/contexture), and how to use it (or its ideas) to rapidly build powerful applications with your elasticsearch (and more!) data. Contexture's ideas impressed the kibana team at the last elasticon, and now it's ready for everyone to see!
